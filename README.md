How to Compile autograder.c

You can open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing autograder.c. Then, type gcc -o autograder autograder.c to compile the code. This will generate an executable file called autograder.
To execute, type ./autograder (x) (y) (z) and replace x y and z with any integer to run the executables with.

The autograder will execute the provided student programs, assess their correctness, and report their performance based on the input parameters.
